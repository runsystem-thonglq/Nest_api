    "context": "Our Company | Our Products | Our Partners | Contact Us\nDrymotic is pleased to announce that our revolutionary vacuum-microwave dehydration process is now being used by more than 30 companies in the food and pharmaceutical industries.\nHere's how it works: Batches of raw organic materials, prepared in small pieces, are loaded into the machine's rotating drum. As the drum turns, moisture is removed from the pieces by microwave energy. The final moisture level can be preset by the operator. The dried pieces retain their color, taste, and nutrition, and are then ready for packaging. Drymotic machines produce better results in less time (and at lower cost) than freeze-drying and air-drying.\nDrymotic machines are available in the following sizes:\nModel Number | Power | Suggested use\nG4200 | 10 kw | Testing new products\nG4260 | 50 kw | Small-scale manufacturers\nH4500 | 100 kw | Large-scale, high-volume manufacturers\n*E-mail*\nTo: customerservice@drymotic.com\nFrom: ovolterra@yambrett.com.au\nDate: 6 May\nSubject: Malfunctioning unit\nDear Customer Service,\nWe purchased a Drymotic unit (product number: G4260, serial number: 01938207) last year for use with our line of instant stew mixes. We had no issues with the unit until the beginning of this month, when we began to notice an increase in processing time. We have followed the recommended cleaning schedule, so this problem cannot be caused by excess residue.\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions for resolving this issue in a timely manner.

He has built dozens of houses in Gore composed almost entirely of reclaimed, recovered, or found materials.\n\"As much as possible, I like to use materials that are already available nearby,\" says Mr. Ybor. \"It just takes some creativity, but that way nothing is wasted and houses can be built for a fraction of the price. Old fencing, discarded bottles, corks, mismatched bricks and tiles—nothing gets overlooked.\"\nWhile Mr. Ybor is fully responsible for creating the design plans for the houses he builds, he always involves homeowners in the building process. With a waiting list of at least a year, Mr. Ybor is able to carefully select his clients. He works solely with homeowners who already know how to operate power tools and are willing to do some of the hands-on work themselves.\nSome of his houses have been featured in magazines, travel shows, and online carpentry demonstrations. Mr. Ybor's Web site, featuring photos of his projects, can be found at yborhabitats.co.nz.\nTo: contact@yborhabitats.co.nz\nFrom: c.holmes@hmail.net\nDate: 4 May\nSubject: Proposal\nDear Mr. Ybor,\nI just read an article about you.

I want to add an extension to my current house, incorporating leftover materials I have from the patio that I had built a few years ago.\n2. My roof needs to be replaced. I have researched ways to cut the cost, and one suggestion was to leave the existing roof intact and just install new metal sheeting on top. I like this idea!\nAre you available and interested in doing this work? I would like to start as early as next month.

With over 400 stations across Asia already, Alacritum brings a wealth of experience to this large-scale undertaking. The Highway 1 stations, known as PRO stations, will provide vehicles with up to 200 kilowatts of power, achieving an 80 percent charge in 30 minutes. The system will periodically notify waiting drivers of the status of their battery charge by sending texts to their cell phones or other mobile devices. The company promises to provide motorists with clean, comfortable, brightly lit waiting facilities.

Although the addition entails higher costs, it will ensure the comfort and safety of the customers. I have also learned firsthand that poor cell service along Highway 1 will make the wireless networks at most PRO stations unreliable, so we will need a technological solution for that as well.

I would like to take photos of the space. I remember your mentioning that the historic architecture of the building would be a draw for customers.\nIn addition, I will need to get a direct quotation from either of you or from Chef Vaux.

Their aim is for Charlotte's to be a gathering place that indulges all the senses, where guests will be met with comfort and hospitality.\nAward-winning executive chef Michel Vaux, most recently of Kahn's in Bloomington, has created an enticing menu featuring fresh-baked breads and grass-fed meats, with locally sourced vegetable dishes as accompaniments. Offerings will include breakfast and lunch selections.

Also, Mr. Roytenberg would like to include the operating hours, which are 8:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. daily.
